Jeff Lemire’s “Black Hammer Universe” is one of the more exciting new worlds I have encountered in comics. While I have generally enjoyed what I have read of the spinoff series, this review concerns the main series. 

At the center of this series is a mystery, and it's a compelling one. A group of former golden/silver age superheroes are trapped on a strange farm, and are unable to leave. As the mystery progresses, Lemire develops the ensemble casts through their interactions with each other and their strange environments.

The story is also sprinkled with a series of flashbacks to the trapped heroes' glory days as superheroes. The versions of the characters we see in the flashbacks resemble popular heroes such as Captain America and other less well known fan favorites like Martian Manhunter. These parallels make the adventure all the more rewarding for fans of the genre. That said, the series is one of the few exciting comic book runs with no preexisting continuity, so it is great for new readers who don't want to spend hours on google disentangling eighty years of storylines to understand the relationships of the characters.

The art is stylized and consistently strong throughout the series. It serves to build and contrast a series of different worlds and environments, and it is deeply intertwined with the narrative.

I find most of the core group of characters multidimensional and interesting. Unfortunately, the first volume in particular focuses primarly on its white characters. The titular character is Black, but does not get much attention in the beginning of the series, and throughout the run I recall few other people of color written with significant roles.

I found volumes two and three to be the peak of the series. I certainly enjoyed the first and fourth volumes as well, but volume four was not as satisfying a conclusion to the arc as I had imagined. 

Overall, I deeply enjoyed this series, and recommend it to new and old comic book readers alike.
