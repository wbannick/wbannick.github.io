On this page, I periodically add some links to other projects or websites that I think are thought provoking and relate to topics I enjoy discussing. I am in no way affiliated with any of this projects unless I specifically say so. My commentary <b>does not</b> reflect the views of those on the page I link to. Please visit their pages for their commentary.

### This website offers a map of where Indigenous peoples lived in the Americas (as well as select other parts of the world).
<i>The following is <b>NOT</b> a review of the site. <b>All opinions below are my own</b> and do not reflect on those who contribute to the project I posted above.</i>

The modern United States of America has been built on (among other things) the forced dispossession and ethnic cleansing of many Indigenous Americans. Contrary to what many of us are taught, Native Americans still live in this country, and I do not mean to distract from that with a discussion of where their ancestors lived. 

But I do think this map is an important starting place for those of us living in the Americas to more deeply interact with the history of the land on which we live. The history of the land beneath our feet did not begin with colonization. I hope the reader follows this link, searches their address, and then researches the tribes that lived there to find out more about them. I hope they focus not only on their history but also their present.

Many us who grow up in the United States are given a very slanted version of American history, and I think it's our responsibility to take the time to remedy this by pursuing a more accurate collection of narratives.

It is also imperative to remember that colonization, ethnic cleansing, racism, and forced dispossession of land are human issues that sadly permeate across national borders and the space of time. Not only is there an extensive international history of these abhorrent practices, but they are also happening today in places such as Palestine. The effects of these acts of violence and persecution have and will ripple through generations. We must critically and self-reflectively engage with these stories and patterns, and attempt to determine what we can do to end them.
