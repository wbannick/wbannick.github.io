For years music has been where I turned to for answers when life was difficult or confusing to me. Each week, I plan on adding a couple bars that have stuck out to me to this page. I hope that people reading this can find meaning in these lyrics too.

```
"Scared to see my daughter now because I'm lost in the life
In the bathroom getting high when she called twice
Sorry, but I'm scared to look at something so precious when I'm a mess"
- MGK
```

## December 11 2020
```
"A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone"
- Lupe Fiasco
```
<br>

## December 04 2020
```
"Fall asleep until the dream comes
Motherf*** reality
Happiness, I think I need some
So I overdose on fantasy"
- MGK
```
<br>

## November 27 2020
```
"Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy"
- Royce Da 5'9
```
