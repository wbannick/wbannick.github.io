For years music has been where I turned to for answers when life was difficult or confusing to me. Each week, I plan on adding a couple lines that have stuck out to me to this page. Some weeks I may instead post the name of a song that I couldn't stop playing recently. I hope that people reading this can find meaning in these lyrics too.

"I hide behind a smile while my mind is runnin' wild
Nervous for no reason, heart beatin' like a mile a minute
Where's the nearest bathroom? I'm in it
Splash some water on my face, wipe it dry, let's get it"
- Joell Ortiz

```
"I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero"
- J Cole
```

```
"You need to check up on your strong friend
The one with strength that's never gon' end
The one with sense, take care of several grown men
Pay they rent and then they trade on him"
- Royce Da 5'9
```

## December 18 2020
```
"Scared to see my daughter now because I'm lost in the life
In the bathroom getting high when she called twice
Sorry, but I'm scared to look at something so precious when I'm a mess"
- MGK
```

## December 11 2020
```
"A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone"
- Lupe Fiasco
```
<br>

## December 04 2020
```
"Fall asleep until the dream comes
Motherf*** reality
Happiness, I think I need some
So I overdose on fantasy"
- MGK
```
<br>

## November 27 2020
```
"Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy"
- Royce Da 5'9
```
