For years music has been where I turned to for answers when life was difficult or confusing to me. Each week, I plan on adding a couple bars that have stuck out to me to this page. I hope that people reading this can find meaning in these lyrics too.

"Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy"
- Royce Da 5'9
