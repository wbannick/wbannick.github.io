For years music has been where I turned to for answers when life was difficult or confusing to me. Each week, I plan on adding a couple bars that have stuck out to me to this page. I hope that people reading this can find meaning in these lyrics too.

## December 04 2020
```
Fall asleep until the dream comes
Motherf*** reality
Happiness, I think I need some
So I overdose on fantasy
- MGK
```

```
"Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy"
- Royce Da 5'9
```
