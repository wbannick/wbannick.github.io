For years music has been where I turned to for answers when life was difficult or confusing to me. Listening to music is theraputic for me and it helped me put words to feelings and realities I was experiencing before I had the courage or means to speak to people about them. Each week, I plan on adding a couple bars that have stuck out to me to this page. I do not plan on adding commentary to any of them. I hope that people reading this can find meaning in these lyrics too.

Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy"
