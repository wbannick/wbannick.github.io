  <p>Below are links to my blog posts. Some will be about politics and/or data science, but many will relate to my other obsessions like hip-hop or comic books.</p>

  <p><b>Americans Support Police Reform and Those Who Are Aware of Systemic Racism Support Restructuring Law Enforcement.</b> This is a piece I wrote on a survey project I designed, managed, and analyzed at YouGov several months ago. I believe it reveals some important trends in support for defunding the police in particular. In the post, I use the phrase "restructuring law enforcement" to convey institutional changes that alter how law enforcement looks and functions. I meant this term to encompass systemic changes including defunding police departments and investing in other sectors. If I were to rewrite this article, I would attempt to use a term that better conveys this concept. I believe defunding the police is crucial for the future of this country.</p>

  <p>I find meaning in music, particularly in hip hop. Every week, I will post a couple of my favorite bars.</p>
