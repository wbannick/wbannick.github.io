  <p><b>Americans Support Police Reform and Those Who Are Aware of Systemic Racism Support Restructuring Law Enforcement.</b> This is a piece I wrote on a survey project I designed, managed, and analyzed at YouGov. I wrote this months ago with some small edits right before it was published. Were I to rewrite it now, I may structured it differently and/or use different wording, but I believe it reveals some important trends in support for defunding the police in particular. I believe defunding the police is crucial for the future of this country.</p>
