# Hello!

My name is William Bannick. I use he/him pronouns. I am from California. More specifically, I grew up in the Central Coast/Bay Area. I have lived in Santa Cruz County, Santa Clara County, and San Mateo County. I spent the last couple of years in the beautiful Washington DC, but I have recently moved to Los Angeles. I am employed as the Lead Data Scientist and a Software Engineer at Politech.

I aspire to leverage data science tools and skills to create change. Systems and policies in this country have bred inequality, and data science itself has been used to target people in damaging and discriminatory ways. But I also believe that data science tools and strategies can be used to fight back and promote better policy.

I am passionate about racial equity, government accountability, disability rights, transgender rights, and ending mass incarceration. I understand the importance of the intersections of these topics and I am interested in them in the global context, as well as in the context of the United States. They extend beyond the borders of the country I live in, and I believe it is important to try to be informed outside of my own national context. I am not an expert in these topics. My understanding of them grows daily. But I am confident that many of our systems need to be restructured and reimagined.

I am a life-long nerd. I could talk for hours about comic books or Star Wars. I also enjoy listening to hip hop, weight training, and _playing_ sports. My professional sports knowledge is out of date by about 10-15 years, but I love playing pick-up basketball, football, and frisbee. And, I am striving to become a more versatile dunker.
