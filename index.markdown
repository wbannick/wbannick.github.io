# Hello!

All views on this site are my own.

My name is William Bannick. I use he/him pronouns. I am from California. More specifically, I grew up in the Central Coast/Bay Area. I have lived in Santa Cruz County, Santa Clara County, and San Mateo County. I love California and it will always be home. I currently live in the beautiful Washington DC.

I am a Data Scientist and I hope to learn to leverage data science tools and skills to create change. Systems and policies in this country have bred inequality, and data science itself has been used to target people in damaging and discriminatory ways. But I also believe that data science tools and skillsets can be used to fight back and promote better policy.

I am passionate about government accountability, racial equity, disability rights, transgender rights, women's rights, criminal justice reform, and combatting gentrification. I understand the importance of the intersections of these topics and I am interested in them in the global context, as well as in the context of the United States. They extend beyond the borders of the country I live in, and I believe it is important to try to be informed outside of my own national context. I am by no means an expert in any of these topics. My understanding of them shifts daily. But I am confident that many of our systems need to be restructured and reimagined. Small changes over the course of one's lifetime are not enough.

I am a life-long nerd. I could talk for hours about comic books or Star Wars. I also enjoy weight training and _playing_ sports. My professional sports knowledge is out of date by about 10-15 years, but I love playing pick-up basketball, football, and frisbee (when there is no pandemic happening).

My personal relationships are very important to me. I am always working to become a better person, a better friend, and a better family member. I try to confront my privilege and mental health to continue to grow as person.
